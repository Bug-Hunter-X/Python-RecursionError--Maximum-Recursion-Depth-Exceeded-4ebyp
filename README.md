# Python RecursionError Example

This repository demonstrates a common error in recursive functions: exceeding the maximum recursion depth. The `factorial` function calculates the factorial of a number. However, it does not handle negative input correctly, leading to infinite recursion.  The solution adds input validation to prevent this error.
